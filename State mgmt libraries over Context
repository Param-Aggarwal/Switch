✅ Your Understanding	          💡 Clarification / Confirmation
Context API is great for small to medium data-sharing cases	                                          ✅ Correct — things like theme, language, auth state, or feature flags
For complex or deeply nested state (e.g., cart, analytics, dashboard data)→ Context becomes messy	    ✅ True — leads to prop-drilling or over-re-renders
  Re-renders in small trees can be optimized via React.memo / useMemo / useCallback	                  ✅ Yes — acceptable in low-scale apps
But for large apps, you need selectors and middleware for efficiency	                                ✅ Correct — Redux/Zustand use selectors so only the consuming components re-render
Context has no persistence (state lost on refresh)	                                                  ✅ Correct — must manually sync to storage
Libraries like Redux / Zustand solve this + add async handling, logging, and devtools	                ✅ Exactly right
Practical rule: Use Context for small, global UI-level data. 
Use state management library for app-level domain data.	                                              ✅ Spot-on best practice






context api is good and helps in sharding the data between multiple components but only in cases where we have samll no of components. or data flow is simple 
i.e parent too child to gradparent and not too complex. in small cases, re-rendering can be handled easily by either using React.memo or useMemo or useCallback
and even after this, if rendering is happening, this is acceptable as not much no of components are being re-rendered. But if my applicaitn has 10's-20s of compoents, 
and have very complex logic of data sharing, then using context becomes repititive and reduces efficency. Also, it accompanies other problems like data not 
stored permanently(if we rfresh the page, data is lost i.e. no persistence). whereas if we use state management libraries which can efficently pass data between
the whole react app, we also get adiitinal features like data persistence, selector based rendering of components, async flow is also handled easily etc. so, 
for complex data sharing, it is preferred to use state mngmt libraries. but for smaller use cases like: session storage maintenance, theme of site, language 
selected by user, context can be used, but some complex data like cart updation, user details, dashoards etc can be shared thoru all app via State mngmt libraries.
