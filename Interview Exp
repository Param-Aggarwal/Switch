Interview Exp



A. Mercor

Frontend: 
- Exp in JPL and Tech stack 
- How complex state management is handled
- Diff between Redux and Zustand and where to use which library ? 
- Their code and logic on how to write stores in each of them and how can we optimise state mutation ? 
- Mutable and immutable states --> which to use in stores and why ? 
- Counter code and how can I optimise that to increment and decrement the counter
- Use fetch custom hook and how can I optimise that? 
- How SSR works and where do we use it ? What problems faced in implementing ? 
System Design: 
- Design a service which gives JS snippet which gathers user events(like user clicks, page routers, scrolls, time spent etc) and give analytics and generate reports and host that on endpoints. 
- How to ensure reliability, de-duplication of events, message queues etc. 
- Implement security (API authorisation), observability, reduce latency (1 million requests per second)
- DB preference and why ? (For storing events data) 


B. Payment Company

C. TripJack

- Accessibility in CSS
- CSS animations
- How will u make responsive web design: a. Media query, b. ? 
- Position property: Types —>  relative or absolute 
- 
- Diff between cookies, session and local storage 
- Diff between var let const
- What is closure
- Callback function
- Callback Hell and Promises 
- What is Event loop  and how does asynchronous tasks happen in js
- What is prototype, polyfills 
- Output based question —> 
let x = 10;
let y = x++;
console.log(x) 
console.log(y)

var a=1;
var b=2;
console.log(a + "-" + b)

function foo(a){
    console.log(a);
}
function foo(a,b){
    console.log(a+b)
}
foo(10);
foo(10,20);

function foo(a){
    return function(){
        console.log(a++)
    }
}
const b = foo(10)
const c = foo(18)
b()
b()
c()

- Ways to pass data between different components
- Why use context, redux, redux toolkit, etc and in what situations
- Lifecycle of React Component
- React coding question: Make a React component that:
    * ✅ Fetches random users from api= "https://randomuser.me/api?results=20”
    * ✅ Displays them in a tabular format
    * ✅ Includes a search bar to filter users by name or city

    Lifecycle methods
    performance optimisation using memo, callback, lazy loading etc
    Flatten a deep nested object, create object from flatted array
    retry with delay for n times until success
    Polyfills for setTimeut, setInterval, throttle, throttle via flush, Promise etc. 
    Infinite scrolling and perform actioin when 90% width is crossed !! 
    Date/time feature
    Create Collapsible File/folder Structure
